### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

This challenge was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid. I learned how to set up a grid layout to create a responsive card feature section, which involved:

- Using CSS Grid:
- Positioning Elements using grid-column and grid-row properties to control the placement of cards.
- Absolute Positioning: I learned how to position icons in the bottom right corner of each card using position: absolute

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue refining my skills in responsive design, particularly in areas like grid layout and advanced media queries.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for implementing the grid on my cards.
- [WAVVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) - This website ensures that you are developing an accessible website.
